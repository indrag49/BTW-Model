# BTW-Model
This is a simple implementation of the BTW model written in Python. This repository was motivated by the lecture series "Self Organised Criticailty" delivered by Prof. Deepak Dhar in "National Summer School on Statistical Physics, 2018" at Satyendra Nath Bose National Centre for Basic Sciences, Kolkata. The topic of the school was: "Introducing Research Topics of Statistical Physics To Young Physicists".
